Automated Network Request Workflow ‚Äì ServiceNow

This project implements an end-to-end automated workflow in ServiceNow to handle all types of network-related service requests. By leveraging Service Catalog, Flow Designer, custom tables, and approvals, the solution streamlines how requests are submitted, routed, approved, and tracked.

üìñ Overview

Organizations frequently receive requests related to network access, device setup, or connectivity issues. Traditionally, these were handled manually, often leading to:

Delays in approvals and assignments.

Miscommunication between employees and IT teams.

Lack of tracking for status and history.

This project addresses those challenges by providing a self-service catalog item with automated workflows that ensures:

Faster request intake.

Automatic approval routing.

Email notifications at each stage.

Centralized visibility for all stakeholders.

üéØ Objectives

Build a user-friendly Service Catalog form for submitting network requests.

Automate backend steps: record creation, approvals, assignments, and updates.

Eliminate unnecessary manual intervention.

Maintain a clear audit trail for compliance and governance.
