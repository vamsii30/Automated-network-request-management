Day 3 – Workflow Automation with Flow Designer

Goal:
Use Flow Designer to automate the handling of network requests by tying together catalog inputs, custom table entries, and the approval process.

Activities Completed:

1. Catalog Data Handling

Used the Get Catalog Variables action to fetch requestor and request details.

Captured key information: Name, Department, Email, Device Type, Location, and Justification.

Confirmed all fields mapped correctly into the workflow actions.

2. Record Management

Added a Create Record step to insert entries into the custom Network table.

Populated fields dynamically from catalog variables, ensuring schema alignment.

3. Notifications

Configured a Send Email step:

Recipients included both the requester and approver.

Subject and body text pulled directly from catalog values.

Tested and enabled outbound email functionality on the instance.

4. Approvals

Integrated the Ask for Approval action on the created record.

Set rules for Approve and Reject, with mode configured as Anyone Approves.

Tied approval responses back into the workflow.

5. Flow Conditions & Updates

Added conditional checks:

On approval → record status updated to “Approved.”

On rejection → record flagged as “Rejected” and flow terminated.

6. Testing & Fixes

Ran full end-to-end submission tests.

Issues resolved:

Renamed variables to avoid duplication errors.

Ignored warnings about unused journal fields.

Enabled email sending when it was disabled in system properties.
