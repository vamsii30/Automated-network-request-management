Day 1 – Service Catalog Configuration

Goal:
Kick off the project by creating a Service Catalog entry to capture network-related service requests and configuring its supporting elements.

Work Completed:

1. Catalog Item Development

Added a new catalog item titled “Network Request Form.”

Structured it to gather key details from end users.

2. Variable Setup

Configured several types of fields:

Text inputs → e.g., Office Location, Notes/Description.

Reference lookup → Field for “Requested for” user.

Dropdown → Device selection (Laptop, Router, Others, etc.).

3. Variable Set

Built a reusable Requester Details variable set, which can be plugged into other catalog items later.

4. Catalog UI Policies

Implemented rules to make the form more dynamic:

Show the field “Other Device Details” only when “Device Type = Others.”

Adjusted which fields are mandatory/visible based on user selections.

5. Evidence & Documentation

Screenshots captured for:

Form design.

Variable creation.

Variable set details.

UI policy demonstration.

Exported the update set related to the Service Catalog module.

Logged today’s progress in the project documentation.
